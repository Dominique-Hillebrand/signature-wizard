# Signature Wizard

## Description

This application shows a PDF document and a signature wizard. The signature wizard collects the user's name and requires a PIN to successfully create a signature.
With the PIN 1337 a digital signature is successfully collected. With any other PIN it shows an error.

## Getting Started

The server has to run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) so it's recommended to run the server first. 
Then run the development server of the **frontend** with:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.
